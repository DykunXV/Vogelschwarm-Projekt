# Vogelschwarm-Projekt

Adds an animated flock of birds into the current scene

## How to use
  1. Download repository as ``.zip ``
  2. In Blender, open ``Edit -> Preferences -> Install...`` and select the downloaded ``.zip``
  3. Activate the addon "Animated Flock of Birds" if it is not activated automatically
  4. That's it. The addon should be working now and you should see a "AFOB Util" Panel.

## Important information
For some reason, if I open Blender without the VS-Code Debugging tool, I get an error when loading the textures. If that is the case for you too, I'd advise to open the addon with the VS-Code Debugging tool.
